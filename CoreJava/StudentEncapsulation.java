                                      Encapsulation
        Encapsulation is "data hiding"
        To hide a data we make the access modifier "private"
        After "hiding data" you may need to "read" or "update" the data
        To "read" or "update" the data we will create some methods
        To "read" "encapsulated data" you should create "get()" methods, we name it "getters"
        To "update" "encapsulated data" you should create "set()" methods, we name it "setters"
       "get()" and "set()" methods are called "Java Beans"

       // Note: By using set() method we prevent confusion and save memory by creating just 1 object.

       If a class is "immutable", it is impossible the value of the existing variable.
       Ä±f you want to make a class "immutable" do not create any "setter" method.

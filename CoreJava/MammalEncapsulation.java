    /*
    Normally child class ust override all "abstract methods" from the parent class.
    But Mammal Class did not override anything from the Animal Class, no complain.

Because "Overriding abstract methods from parent" is "Concrete Classes"
"Overriding abstract methods from parent" is NOT mandatory for abstract classes.

If you want you can override abstract methods from parent Animal to Mammal, it is optional.
